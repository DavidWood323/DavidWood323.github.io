                        Age 61 now retired from mainstream career which started in the oilfield North Sea 1988.
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        After a posting to the Far East in 1991 later relocated from UK to Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia in 1996.
                       
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Retired early from the oilfield and returned to the UK in 2014 when my elder son started university.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        A Passion for Music that spanned 15 years…..& then it was gone
                      
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Started with my kids, something missing from my life was the ability to play an instrument and in 2002 aged 7 
                        <br/>
                        my elder boy 
                   
                        was happy to start lessons. The teacher said well guitar not going so well but watch this on 
                        <br/>
                        drums and for the next 12 years 
               
                        till we left Malaysia in 2014 he never missed lessons.
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>  
                        Younger brother joined shortly taking up bass guitar lessons with the same teacher. 
                    
                        <br/>
                        <br/> 
                        A couple of years on from kids in early training my house started to fill up with drum kits guitars
                        <br/>  
                                        
                        and the whole band kit and the music teacher now coming to us for the weekly lessons.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Along the way a local professional musician became a close family friend, younger brother on bass 
                        <br/>
                        became a weekly regular at open mike playing with most of the artists, older bro joined with a snare 
                        <br/>
                        and hi-hat for the open mikes and somehow the family social life was transformed.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        
                       
                        Lessons from one local musician and an active social life with another, at home, at our friends and 
                        <br/>
                        all about the city
                      
                        of Kota Kinabalu every week became a full on music event for all of us. It became 
                        <br/>
                        a norm after a couple of years 
                        
                        we all just had an active social life and the music became incidental 
                        <br/>
                        yet the foundation of it all. It was and 
                        
                        became an extravaganza, the private music lessons were now 
                        <br/>
                        full on jam sessions and around town both boys 
                       
                        were playing with professionals & performing   
                        <br/>
                        on stage and we just kept meeting more and more and more musicians. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I lived in Malaysia but I worked in Thailand. 4 mainstream live genres of Thai music and I love them 
                        <br/>
                        all and 
                       
                        don’t have time to expand. Thai music was an influence on the home front with the drummer, 
                        <br/>
                        and later he developed a passion for Japanese music. Both boys got tours of Thailand and Thai bands in a
                        <br/>
                        life a tourist would rarely see.
                         
                       
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Oh dear…it pretty much ended in 2014 with a return to the UK. 
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Elder boy off to university the younger clogged down with studies and no longer in the music scene.
                        <br/>
                        Younger boy now just finished university 
                        I mentioned you gotta pick up that bass and get back to where you were.
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Otherwise
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Decided to make a return to the oilfield Nov 2022, nicely got my old job back in Thailand & 
                        then promptly failed 
                        <br/>
                        the offshore medical in Bangkok. A stress test ECG produced an equivocal result and no more offshore job. 

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Returned to Kota Kinabalu for several weeks after an 8 years absence while waiting for a heart scan  in Kuala Lumpur. 
                        <br/>
                        Jan 2023, heart scan all good but enough to hang up my rig boots if I can't pass the stress ECG.
